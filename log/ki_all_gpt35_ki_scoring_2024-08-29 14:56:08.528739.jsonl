A coalition of African nations could more powerfully represent the unique identity of Africa. A unified African state would garner respect in a world where size and influence are the primary considerations. The minimal notice given to African resistance against the French nuclear experiments in the Sahara, coupled with the shameful display of the U.N. in Congo arguing over legal minutiae as the nation verged on collapse into chaos, demonstrates the blatant indifference of the Major Powers towards African sovereignty. To avert the perils of fragmentation, Africa must establish a political union that not only maintains regional peace but also sets a global example of unity. Such consolidation will amplify the voice and respect for the African identity internationally. The global disregard for African objections to French nuclear testing and the disheartening display at the UN regarding the Congo crisis underscore the crucial need for this unity as seen by the major powers.\nKwame Nkrumah, Ghanian leader, 1961 Which of the following best exemplifies the main theme of the passage?\nYour output must strictly follow this format:\n{\"U)\": <\"True\" or \"False\">, \"V)\": <\"True\" or \"False\">, \"W)\": <\"True\" or \"False\">, \"X)\": <\"True\" or \"False\">}\nYour output:"}
